"Prepare all source files, stylesheets, and asset files to be served with \`mm serve\`.

Usage:

$ mm build [--analyze]

Details:

\`mm build\` will compile all of your code, stylesheets, etc. into static files 
that browsers can understand. The files will be placed into the ./build folder.

Running \`mm serve\` will serve these static files and run Node helpers as needed 
based on the config.

\`mm build\` can take a long time, but it performs optimizations that make the 
application load and run faster.

Examples:

build files for \`mm serve\`
  $ yarn mm build

show information about the compiled files after building
  $ yarn mm build --analyze"

exports[`shows help message on '$ mm serve -h' 1`] = `
"Serve prebuilt files and run Node helpers.

Usage:

$ mm serve [--build] [--view] [--browser]

Details:

\`mm serve\` will serve files previously built with \`mm build\` and run Node 
helpers as needed based on the config.

Unlike \`mm start\`, \`mm serve\` doesn't automatically update on file changes.

\`mm view\` can connect to \`mm serve\` on another device.

(Compare \`mm serve\` to \`npm run serveronly\` in MM2.)

Examples:

serve from a build for another device
  $ yarn mm serve

run \`mm build\` before serving if necessary
  $ yarn mm serve --build

serve and view in Electron on the same device
  $ yarn mm serve --view

serve and view in a browser on the same device
  $ yarn mm serve --browser"

exports[`shows help message on '$ mm start -h' 1`] = `
"Start the app and instantly see changes to your source files.

Usage:

$ mm start [--no-view] [--browser]

Details:

\`mm start\` compiles your files on the fly and updates the app instantly as you 
update your code or config.

Use it to quickly configure your mirror or develop your module before optimizing 
performance with \`mm build\`.

Examples:

Start with live updates
  $ yarn mm start

Start in a browser instead of Electron
  $ yarn mm start --browser

Start to be viewed on another device with \`mm view\`
  $ yarn mm start --no-view"
